# Project Title

## Iris Flower Classification with Artificial Neural Network

## Description

This project is an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the classification of Iris flowers. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning, and it contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The goal of this project is to use a deep learning approach with an ANN to accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on the provided measurements. The ANN is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to measure its classification accuracy.

By utilizing this ANN-based approach, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in solving real-world classification problems and provides a practical example for those interested in applying neural networks to similar tasks.
